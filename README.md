## Digital Marketplace Runner
A utility to run your API/frontend repositories together (and backing services if required), while allowing you to
interact with the running processes and their logs. This script is primarily compatible with OSX; running against other
OSs may require some care and consideration. At its simplest, as an existing developer, you should be able to clone this
repo, run `make config` and edit the default config provided, then run `make` to bring up all your checked out apps.

## Prerequisites
* You must have the following tools available in order to successfully use the DM Runner:
  * Python 3 (including headers if appropriate) installed globally with `pip` and `virtualenv` packages.
  * Nix 17.09 installed and in your path - you'll need to close/re-open your shell. (https://nixos.org/nix/download.html)
  * Docker/*Docker for Mac 17.09+* installed and running (if you want backing services managed for you).

## Instructions
1. Ensure your environment meets the requirements.
1. Clone this repository into an empty directory (e.g. `~/gds`, `~/dm`, or whatever), so that you have something like 
`~/gds/dmrunner`.
2. Run `make setup` - follow instructions.
4. Run `make` to bring up the Digital Marketplace locally.

## `make` commands
### Options
* `make setup` - Verifies your local environment is suitable and performs basic setup.
* `make`/`make run` - Launches all repos using `make run-app`.
* `make all` - Launches all repos with an initial `make run-all` to build eg frontend assets.

## Commands
After the apps have done their initial boot-up cycle, you have a few commands at your disposal which are detailed below.
There is tab-completion for app names and you can scroll up/down to see your command history.

#### H / Help
Print out a list of commands available to you.

#### S / Status
Print out current status of the running apps.

#### B / Branch / Branches
Print which branches you're running for each app.

#### R / Restart
Restart any failed or down apps using `make run-app`.

#### RB / Rebuild
Rebuild and restart any failed or down apps using `make run-all`, which also does NPM install and frontend-build.

#### F / Filter
By default, incoming logs from all apps are interleaved together. You can use this to toggle on a filter to show only
logs from specific apps. With no arguments, this command resets any filters, showing all logs. With arguments, the
closest-matching app name for each word will be filtered in for logging purposes (eg 'f api buyer' will cause only
logs for the data api and the buyer-frontend to be shown).

#### FE / Frontend
Runs `make frontend-build` against frontend apps. With arguments, the closest-matching app name for each word will be
rebuilt (eg 'fe buyer supplier' will run a `frontend-build` on the buyer-frontend and the supplier-frontend. With no
arguments, all frontend apps will be rebuilt. This is a one-off rebuild; for ongoing rebuilds use `FW`.

#### K / Kill
Kill apps that are running. With no arguments, all apps will be killed. With arguments, the closest-matching app name
for each word will be killed (eg 'k search briefs' will take down the search-api and the briefs-frontend).

#### Q / Quit
Kill all running apps and quit back to your shell.

## Logs
Regardless of filtering, all logs are also stored in `./logs` for later reading if required.

## Troubleshooting

## Todo
* Refactoring...
* Manage config better.
* Add Nix detection to setup and, by default, run apps using Nix to avoid local requirements on node/npm/bower/etc.
* Allow use of frontend-build:watch to continually rebuild assets
